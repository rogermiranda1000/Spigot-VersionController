/**
 * Implementations of this interface convert instances of type {@code T1} to a serializable type
 * {@code T2} and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * Which types {@code T2} are serializable depends on the underlying storage system. Currently,
 * all storage systems support the following types:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code Boolean}</li>
 *     <li>{@code Long}</li>
 *     <li>{@code Double}</li>
 *     <li>{@code String}</li>
 *     <li>(Nested) {@code List}s of the other types</li>
 *     <li>(Nested) {@code Set}s of the other types</li>
 *     <li>(Nested) {@code Map}s of the other types</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * That means that if you want to support all currently available configuration store formats,
 * your {@code Serializer} implementation should convert an object of type {@code T1} into one
 * of the seven types listed above.
 *
 * @param <T1> the type of the objects that should be serialized
 * @param <T2> the serializable type
